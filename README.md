# Py-Nomics ReadME

This program is meant for interfacing with the [Nomics.com API](http://docs.nomics.com/), and delivering data on a per-need basis. This API wrapper is most useful for those that want to acquire historic data to explore price action of currencies, and is not useful for real time trading.

Interested users must first sign up for a free Nomics API key, which may be obtained [here](https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api).

If you need help generally with the Nomics API, or have feature/support requests, you can leave a comment in the [Nomics forums](https://forums.nomics.com/).
